GO + Fiber + GORM + Docker + Swagger +Migrations + Air + Jenkins 

Fiber is an Express inspired web framework built on top of Fasthttp, the fastest HTTP engine for Go. 

Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containers—standardized, executable components that combine application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

GORM provides a migrator interface, which contains unified API interfaces for each database that could be used to build your database-independent migrations.

Hot reloading with a package called air to rebuild the app when it has changes. The command runs an installation through the DockerFile and ,then, it builds the container through docker-compose.yml
